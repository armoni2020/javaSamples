# Nimbus
This is the representation of a single data object that is part of a much larger system.

The DropDown is a way to handle all drop down lists in the Nimbus application with one database table.
The lists are then able to be managed 1) without code updates, and 2) from inside the application by an authenticated administrator.

The DropDown object was chosen as an example because it applies several different concepts and design patterns used in the Nimbus application.
